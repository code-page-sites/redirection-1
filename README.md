# Redirection and CDN service

ðŸ‘‰Website (https://replace.vercel.app)ðŸ‘ˆ

#Languages
We use HTML, CSS, JavaScript and other programming languages such as PHP (currently not supported as we are using vercel to deploy, which means it does not have PHP installed) and python.

Although there are other programming languages that are listed in the github languages at the side, that is only for the source code of pypmyadmin and wordpress, which we intend to use once we figure out how to install PHP on our website.

#How to use
You can simply clone this repository and run it on your own. It is totally free. There is also free code for redirection designs, video players and many more. (see directory main/cdn for the full list)

#CDN
Our CDN (Content Delivery Network) provider is Arvancloud (https://arvancloud.com), a free Iranian CDN and cloud computing provider.
